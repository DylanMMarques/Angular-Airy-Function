# Angular Airy function

The scripts presented in this paper were used to compute the results from the paper:

If you publish scientific results based on this scripts, please consider citing the paper.

The results are based on a Fabry-PÃ©rot (FP) model illuminated with a focused beam.
The equations shown in the paper are implemented in the file angularAiryFunction.jl. 

The 3 scripts available do:
* Item angularAiryFunction.jl - implementation of the equations shown in the paper;
* Item modelCompairison.jl - compute the data shown in fig. 2;
* Item intuitiveUnderstanding - compute the data shown in fig. 3;

To compute the results, we use Jolab.jl which (indirectly) implements the angular Airy function.
